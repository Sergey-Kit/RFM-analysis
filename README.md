# RFM-analysis
RFM analysis is a simple python script (and IPython notebook) to perform RFM analysis from customer purchase history data.

Steps:
- Plots were plotted for each variable of interest. 
- Graphically, the optimal thresholds for separating categories are determined.
- The categories are also defined using the k-means method.
- Three-dimensional graphs of distributions are constructed.
- Each client is assigned its own class in accordance with the division by features.
